        <p> Welcome to my website's home page. This is a navigation page for my site,
            allowing you, the user, to easily access other shit I have made.
            Simply click on one of the links at the top of the screen to navigate to
            another page.

        <h2>What is This Site?</h2>
        <p> This site is where I have aggregated all of my websites. Most of these
            sites are for testing or (personal) learning purposes, but some are more useful or
            entertaining, such as games, tools, and more. Also this site is ugly as fuck.
